# Data Structures and Algorithms Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems. The problems are typically sourced from coding platforms, interview preparations, and algorithmic competitions. Each problem solution is implemented in a programming language, and the repository is organized by topics or platforms.

## Topics

Here is a list of common data structure and algorithm topics covered in this repository:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
- Recursion and Divide & Conquer
- and more...

## Platforms

In addition to topics, this repository also includes solutions from various coding platforms, such as:

- LeetCode (majority)
- HackerRank
- Codeforces
- Project Euler
- and others...
